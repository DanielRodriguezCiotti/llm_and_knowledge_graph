            "text": "The lunar geological record has much to tell us about the earliest history of the Solar System, the origin and evolution of the Ea rth-Moon system, the ge ological evolution of rocky planets, and the near-Earth cosmic environment throughout Solar System history. In addition, the lunar surface offers outstanding opp ortunities for research in astronomy, astrobiology, fundamental physics,  life sciences and human physiology and medicine. This paper provides an inte rdisciplinary review of outstanding lunar science objectives in all of these different areas. It is concluded that addressing them satisfactorily will require an end to the 40- year hiatus of lunar surface exploration, and the placing of new scientific instrume nts on, and the return of additional samples from, the surface of the Moon. Some of thes e objectives can be achieved robotically (e.g. through targeted sample return, the de ployment of geophysical networks, and the placing of antennas on the lunar surface to form radio telescopes). However, in the longer term, most of these scientific obj ectives would benefit significantly from renewed human operations on the lunar surface. For these reasons it is highly desirable that current plans for renewed robotic surface exploration of the Moon are developed in the context of a future human lunar exploration programme, such as that proposed by the recently formulat ed Global Exploration Roadmap.

            "text": " Over the last decade there has been a renaissance in lunar exploration conducted from orbit about the Moon, with the followi ng countries all sending remote-sensing spacecraft to lunar orbit during this period: European Space Agency: SMART-1 (2004); Japan: Kaguya (2007); China: Cha ng\u2019e-1 (2007), Chang\u2019e-2 (2010); India: Chandrayaan-1 (2008); and the United Stat es: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO; 2009), GRAIL (2012). However, none of thes e spacecraft were designed to land on the Moon\u2019s surface in a controlled manner, although the US Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS; co-launched with LRO) and the Chandrayaan-1 Moon Impact Probe (MIP) di d deliberately impact the lunar surface in an effort to detect polar volatiles. Indeed, it is sobering to realise that no spacecraft of any kind has successfully landed on the Mo on in a controlled manner since the Russian robotic sample return mission L una 24 in August 1976, and that no human being has set foot on the Moon since Apollo 17 in December 1972. In this paper we argue that this long hiatus in lunar surface exploration has been to the detriment of lunar and planetary science, and indeed of other sciences also, and that the time has come to resume the robotic and human exploration of the surface of the Moon.  The strong scientific case for renewed luna r exploration was already recognized in a comprehensive study conducted by the European Space Agency in 1992 on \u201cEurope\u2019s Priorities for the Scientif ic Exploration and Utiliza tion of the Moon\u201d (ESA 1992). Many of the conclusions of this earlier study  remain valid today, albeit with some need of updating in light of more recent di scoveries, and we will follow its basic framework in what follows. In particul ar, the ESA study found that lunar science objectives can logically be di vided into three categories: (i) Science of the Moon (i.e.  studies of the Moon itself); (ii) Science on the Moon (i .e. studies using the lunar surface as a platform for scie ntific investigations not di rectly related to the Moon itself); and (iii) Science from the Moon (i .e. studies utilising th e lunar surface as a platform for astronomical observations).

            "text": " From a planetary science perspective, the primary importance of the Moon arises from the fact that, owing to a lack of recen t geological activity and active erosional processes, it has an extremely ancient surfac e, mostly older than 3 billion years with some areas extending almost all the way back  to the origin of the Moon 4.5 billion years ago (e.g. Hiesinger and Head 2006; Jaumann et al., 2012). Its relatively accessible near-surface environment theref ore preserves a record of the early geological evolution of a terrest rial planet, which more complex planets such as Earth, Venus and Mars, have long lost, and of the Earth-Moon system in particular. Moreover, the lunar surface provides a plat form for geophysical instruments (e.g. seismometers and heat-flow probes) to probe the structure and composition of the deep interior, which is also required if  we are to use the Moon as a model for terrestrial planet evolution.  Last, but not le ast, the Moon\u2019s outer la yers also preserve a record of the environment in the i nner Solar System (e.g. meteorite flux, interplanetary dust density, solar wind flux and composition, galactic cosmic ray flux) throughout Solar System history, much of wh ich is relevant to understanding the past habitability of our own planet (e.g. Crawford, 2006; Cockell, 2010).    Gaining access to this information lies primarily in the domain of the geosciences (i.e. geology, geophysics, and geochemistry), and will  require a return to  the lunar surface with robotic and/or human missions.

This study identified, and prioritized, eight top-level scientific \u2018concepts\u2019 (each of which can be broken down into multiple individual science goals), and identified th e capabilities that would be required of space missions designed to address them. We not e that several of these objectives (i.e. those which could be addre ssed by a South Pole-Aitken Basin sample return mission and a lunar geophysics network) were also  strongly endorsed by the recent US Planetary Science Decadal Survey (NRC,  2011).

However, the current calibration of the cratering rate, us ed to convert crater densities to absolute ages, is neither as complete nor as reliable as it is often made out to be. For example, there are no calibration points that are older than about 3.85 Ga , and crater ages younger than about 3 Ga are also uncertain (e .g. Hiesinger et al., 2012).  Furthermore,  longitudinal variations in the cratering ra te on the surface of the Moon are predicted by orbital dynamics models, bu t these are difficult to confirm with existing data (Le Feuvre and Wieczorek, 2011). Improving the calib ration of the cratering rate would be of great value for planetary science fo r the following three reasons: (i) It would provide better estimates for the ages of unsam pled regions of the lunar surface; (ii) It would provide us with a more reliable estima te of the impact hist ory of the inner Solar System, especially that of our  own planet; and (iii) The luna r impact rate is used, with various other assumptions, to date the surfaces of other planets for which samples have not been obtained (inc luding key events and stratig raphic boundaries on Mars), and to the extent that the lunar rate remains unreliable so do the age estimates of surfaces on the other terrestrial planets.

            "text": "In principle, obtaining an improved crat ering chronology is st raightforward: it \u2018merely\u2019 requires the sampling, and radiom etric dating, of surfaces having a wide range of crater densities, supplemented where possible by dating of impact melt deposits from individual craters and basi ns (St\u00f6ffler, et al., 2006). However, in  practice this is likely to require the implementation of multiple missions to many different sites (see the detailed discussi on by St\u00f6ffler, et al., 2006). These might be robotic missions, ideally involving r over-facilitated mob ility and either in situ  radiometric dating or, preferably, a sample  return capability (e.g. Shearer and Borg, 2006). The possibilities of robotic in situ  radiometric dating techniques have been investigated by a number of workers (e.g. Ta lboys et al., 2009; Trieloff et al., 2010), and such in situ  measurements may be able to address some key questions in lunar science (e.g. verifying the approximate ag es of the youngest lava flows estimated by crater counting). However, th e practicality of performing in situ  radiometric dating with sufficient accuracy to obtain definitive results for chronology has been questioned (e.g. Taylor et al., 2006). Additiona l robotic sample return missions to key localities, such as the South Pole-Aitken basin (as envisaged by the MoonRise proposal; Jolliff et al., 2010) would undoubtedly improve our knowledge in key respects (Cohen and Coker, 2010). However it is likely to prove impractical to target dedicated robotic sample return missions to sufficient locations to fully characterise lunar chronology. Given the enhanced mobility, sample collection efficiency and sample return capacity actually demonstrat ed by the Apollo missions (e.g. Vaniman et al., 1991; Crawford, 2012), it seems clear that obtainin g anything approaching a complete lunar impact chronology will, at the very least, be greatly facilitated by new human missions to the lunar surface.

The thickn ess of the crust, which is critical for estimating the bulk composition of the Moon, is  debated, with recent estimates being almost half of those made during the A pollo era. The existence of a seismic discontinuity in the mantle 500 km below the surface, which could either be a reflection of primordial differentiation or la ter magmatic processes, is also debated. Four heat flow measurements (at two site s each) were made during Apollo (Langseth et al. 1976) in order constr ain the Moon\u2019s bulk compositi on and thermal evolution, but in retrospect, these were found to be ma de near the edge of an atypical province enriched in heat-producing elements (Jolliff et al., 2000). It is not clear if these unique measurements are representative of either the ancient feldspathic highlands terrane, or of the more volcanically active Procel larum KREEP terrane. Though most data indicate that the Moon has a small molten core (e.g. Weber et al., 2011), neither its size nor composition are well constrained, and the existence of a solid inner core has remained elusive.

While a few such measurements can be made from orbit (such as the measurement of the Moon\u2019s gravity and magnetic fields; Pu rucker and Nicholas 2010, Zuber et al., 2011), most require geophysical instruments to be placed on, or below, the lunar surface. Key instruments in this respect are seismometers, to probe the structure of the deep interior (e.g. Lognonn\u00e9, 2005; Yama da et al., 2011), heat-flow probes to measure the heat loss from the lunar interior and its spatial variati ons (Langseth, et al., 1976), and magnetometers to measure th e thermal conductivity profile. Such instruments can in principle be placed a nd operated on the lunar surface robotically without direct human intervention, such  as envisaged for the proposed Farside Explorer (Mimoun et al., 2012) and Lune tte (Neal et al.,  2011) missions, the International Lunar Network (Cohen et al., 2010; also http://iln.arc.nasa.gov/ ), and the LunarNet penetrator concept (Smith et al ., 2012). Nevertheless, as discussed below, human deployment of such instrument s would be extremely beneficial.",

Quantifying and unders tanding this diversity will require detailed chemical and mineralogical analysis of rocks and soils from as yet unsampled regions of the lunar surface.  In  particular, no samples have yet been returned from the polar regi ons or the far-side,  thus greatly limiti ng our knowledge of lunar geological processes. Although, sta tistically, many of the 160 or so known lunar meteorites ( http://meteorites.wustl.edu/luna r/moon_meteorites_list_alpha.htm ) must originate from these areas, and provide an excellent statistical sampling of the lunar crust (e.g. Korotev, 2005), the value of these materials is limited by a lack of knowledge of their source regions and thus geological context.

A lthough an alternative would be to make robotic in situ  geochemical measurements, as proposed for both the Farside Explorer (Mimoun et al., 2012) a nd LunarNet (Smith et al., 2012) mission concepts, a full understanding of  geological processe s requires the ab ility to measure the isotopic composition and concentrations of minor and trace elements at levels that may be beyond the capabilities of in situ  robotic instruments. In addition, mobility is crucially important if the local geological dive rsity in the vicinity of a landing site is to be properly characterized.

            "text": " As noted in the SCEM Report,  the lunar poles potentially bear witness to the flux of volatiles present in the inner Solar System throughout much of Solar System history.  In 1998 the Lunar Prospector  neutron spectrometer f ound evidence of enhanced concentrations of hydrogen at the luna r poles (Feldman et al., 1998), which was widely interpreted as indicating the presence  of water ice in the floors of permanently shadowed polar craters. Radar observations ha ve also been used to infer the presence of ice in such regions (e.g. Spudis et al., 2010; but see Fa et al. 2011 for an alternative interpretation). The presence of water i ce in permanently shadowed craters was supported by the LCROSS impact experiment , which found a water ice concentration of 5.6 \u00b1 2.9 % by weight  in the target regolith  at the Cabeus crater  (Colaprete et al., 2010). It seems likely that this  water is ultimately derived from the impacts of comets (and/or water-rich aste roids) with the lunar surface,  although solar wind implantation and endogenic sources might also contribut e (for a brief review see Anand, 2010). However, the inferred quantity of water is sensitive to the calibration of the spectrometers on the LCROSS probe and a numb er of other assumptions (Colaprete et al. 2010). Ideally, therefore, this result needs to be confirmed by in situ  measurements.  ",

(2012), obtaining improved knowledge of the presence, composition, and abundance of water (and other volatiles) at the lunar poles is impo rtant for several reasons:   \uf0b7 It is probable that the ice in perman ently shadowed regions is ultimately derived from comet and/or asteroid imp acts. Even though the original volatiles will have been considerably reworked, it is likely that some information concerning the composition of the original sources will remain. Among other things, this may yield astrobiologically  important knowledge on the role of comets and meteorites in delivering volat iles and pre-biotic  organic materials to the terrestrial planets (Chyba and Sagan 1992; Pierazzo and Chyba 1999).    The processes involved in the creation, re tention, migration, and destruction of OH and H2O across the surface of the Moon are likely to be common on other air-less bodies, and quantifying them on th e Moon will give us better insight into the volatile history and potential av ailability of water elsewhere in the inner solar system.    \uf0b7 Lunar polar ice deposits are of consider able astrobiological interest, even if they do not retain vestigial information concerning their ultimate sources. This is because any such ices will have b een subject to irradiation by galactic cosmic rays and, as such, may be e xpected to undergo organic synthesis  reactions (e.g. Lucey, 2000). Analogous reactions may be important for producing organic molecules in the icy ma ntles of interstella r dust grains, and on the surfaces of outer Solar System satellites and comets (e.g. Bernstein et al., 2002; Elsila et al., 2007), but the lunar poles are much more accessible than any of these other locations.   \uf0b7 The presence of water ice at the lunar poles, and even hydrated materials at high-latitude but non-shadowed localitie s, could potentially provide a very valuable resource in the context of futu re human exploration of the Moon (e.g. Anand et al., 2012; this issue).

The requirements for permanently shadowed e nvironments and high latitude, but non-permanently shadowed, environments are ra ther different. The conditions within permanently shadowed areas, where temperat ures can be below 40 K (Paige et al., 2010), are not readily amenable to human expl oration or even robotic vehicles (unless these are equipped with a nuc lear power source or long- lived batteries capable of operating at very low temperatures). For these environments a penetrator-based system, such as envisaged in the MoonLI TE and LunarNet mission concepts (Gao et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2012), may be a possibility. On the other hand, non-permanently shadowed polar localities are amenable to solar-powered robotic exploration, and proposals such as ESA\u2019 s Lunar Lander (Carpenter et al., 2010; 2012), and \u2018Lunar Beagle\u2019 (Gib son et al., 2010), would provide valuab le initial  measurements of volatiles in these e nvironments. In the longer term, a full characterization of polar volat iles, as for other aspects of lunar geology, would benefit from the increased mobility and flexib ility that would be provided by human exploration (which would of c ourse be facilitated at the po les if exploita ble quantities of volatiles prove to be present).

Since the SCEM Report was published new remote sensing observations have indicated that l unar volcanism is even more diverse than previously thought, with the identificati on of probable areas of non-mare silicic volcanism on both the near- and far-sides (G lotch et al., 2010; Jo lliff et al., 2011). There is no doubt that these areas would benefit from in situ  investigation. However, from a lunar exploration perspective, this is  just one aspect of the wider requirement to sample a diverse set of lunar rocks (Section 2.3), and th e implications for exploration capabilities ar e essentially the same.

Yet our knowledge of impact processes is based on a combination of theoretical modelling, small-scale laboratory hyper-velocity impact experiments, and fiel d geological studies of generally poorly-preserved terrestrial impact craters (Melosh, 1989). The Moon provides a unique record of essentially pristine impact crater s of all sizes (from mi cron-sized pits up to  1000-km impact basins). Field studies, combining sample collection (including drill cores) and in situ  geophysical studies (e.g. active se ismic profiling), of the ejecta blankets and sub-floor struct ures of pristine lunar crater s of a range of sizes would greatly aid in our understandi ng of the impact cratering process. As discussed by Crawford (2004), the implied requirements  for mobility, deployment of complex geophysical instruments, sub-surface drilling, and sample return capacity are likely to outstrip the capabilities of pur ely robotic exploration and would be greatly facilitated by a human exploration programme.

In addition to their scientific interest, better characterisation of the composition, volatile content and mechanical properties of l unar regolith will also be important for planning In-Situ Resource Util isation (ISRU) applications in support of future lunar exploration activ ities (e.g. Anand et al., 2012; Schwandt et al., 2012). As noted in Section 2.4, the nature of relatively  cold high-latitude regoliths, which have never been sampled or studied in situ , and which may contain a volatile component, are of particular interest. Many of the properties of both high- and low-latitude regoliths could be investigated  by appropriate instruments on robotic soft-landers such as ESA\u2019s proposed Lunar Lander (Carpenter et al., 2012) or  penetrators such as the LunarNet concept (Smith et al., 2012).

            "text": "Another important aspect of the lunar regolith  is the record it contains of early solar and Solar System history. Studies of Apollo  samples have revealed that solar wind  particles are efficiently implanted in the l unar regolith (McKay et al., 1991; Lucey et al., 2006), which therefore contains a record  of the composition and evolution of the Sun throughout Solar System history (e.g. Wi eler et al., 1996). Recently, samples of the Earth\u2019s early atmosphere appear to have been retrieved from lunar regolith samples (Ozima et al., 2005; 2008), and it has been suggested that samples of Earth\u2019s early crust may also be preserved there in the form of terrestrial meteorites (Guti\u00e9rrez,, 2002; Armstrong et al., 2002; Crawford et al., 2008; Armstrong, 2010). Meteorites derived from elsewhere in the Solar System will likely also be found on the Moon, preserving a record of the dynamical evolution of small bodies throughout Solar System history (Joy et al., 2011; 2012). Last but not least, the lunar regolith may contain a record of galactic events, by preserving the sign atures of ancient galactic cosmic ray (GCR) fluxes, and the possible accumulation of interste llar dust particles during passages of the Sun th rough dense interstellar clo uds (Crozaz et al., 1977; McKay et al., 1991; Crawford  et al., 2010). Collectivel y, these lunar geological records would provide a window into the early evolution of  the Sun and Earth, and of the changing galactic environment of the So lar System, that is unlikely to be obtained in any other way. Much of this record ha s clear astrobiological implications, as it relates to the conditions under which lif e first arose and evolved on Earth.  ",

            "text": "From the point of view of accessing ancien t Solar System history it will be desirable to find layers of ancient regoliths ( palaeoregoliths ) that were formed and buried billions of years ago, and thus protected fr om more recent geological processes, (e.g. Spudis, 1996; Crawford et al., 2010; Fagents et al., 2010; see Figure 1 of Crawford et al., 2010 for a pictorial representation of the process). Locating and sampling such deposits will likely be an important objectiv e of future lunar expl oration activities, but  they will not be easy to access.  A lthough robotic sampling missions might in principle be able to access palaeoregoliths at  a limited number of favorable sites (for example where buried layers outcrop in the walls of craters or rilles), fully sampling this potentially rich geological archive of Solar System history will probably require the mobility and sample return capabil ities of human exploration (Spudis, 2001; Garvin, 2004; Crawford, 2004) . The specific requirement s of a human exploration architecture capable of locating and sampling palaeoregolith deposits have been described elsewhere (Crawford et al., 2010). ",

            "text": " The final broad lunar science area discusse d by the SCEM Report re lated to studies of the lunar atmosphere and near-surface dust envi ronment. Of particular interest is the need to characterise the composition of th e tenuous lunar exosphere (which has a variable density in the range 105 \u2013 107 atoms or molecules cm-3; Lucey et al., 2006), and its interaction with the surface regolith. Th is in turn will help constrain models of the lunar volatile budget discussed in Se ction 2.4. The extent to which transient releases of gasses into the atmosphere may occur is also of interest, as this may correlate with on-going low-le vel geological activity (C rotts, 2008). The surface dust environment, and especially the exte nt to which dust grains may become electrostatically charged and transported, is  another important research topic (e.g. Gr\u00fcn et al., 2011; Pines et al., 2011; Horanyi  and Stern, 2011), not least because of the potential hazards mobile  dust may pose to scientific instruments and human operations on the surface (NRC, 2007; Loft us et al., 2010; Linnarsson et al., 2012). Some of the processes involved are likely to be common on other air-less bodies, and  quantifying them on the relati vely accessible lunar surface will therefore give us better insight into regolit h/exosphere interactions throughout the Solar System.

These may be provided by suita bly instrumented robotic landers, such as ESA\u2019s proposed Lunar Lander mission (Car penter et al., 2012). However, it is important to note that the landed missions ha ve the potential to significantly disturb the tenuous lunar atmospheric environment, a nd that this will be especially true of human operations (NRC, 2007). It is therefore scientifically highly desirable that the lunar atmosphere/exosphere be properly char acterized by minimally invasive robotic probes before human operations are resumed on the lunar surface.

The metamorphism and alteration of terrestria l Archaean (i.e. >2.5 Gyr old) rocks and their organic microfossils limits the quan tity of material that can be used to understand the nature of early life on the Ea rth. The possibility th at rocks ejected by asteroid and comet impacts on the early Earth may have landed on the Moon provides a tantalising possibility for a lunar surface source of early  Earth material (Guti\u00e9rrez,, 2002; Armstrong et al. 2002; Crawford et  al., 2008; Armstrong, 2010). The quantity of this material is predicted to be as much as 200 kg/km2. The Moon may also have collected material ejected from other pl anetary bodies in the Solar System. Early rocks from Mars and Venus, both of wh ich have early histories of enormous biological interest, might also exist on the Moon (Gladman et al. 1996; Armstrong et al. 2002), although the quantity and distribution a nd condition of this material is more uncertain. In addition, the l unar regolith, and especially buried palaeoregoliths (Spudis 1996), likely contains a record of solar wind flux (and thus solar luminosity) and galactic cosmic rays (and thus the gala ctic environment of the solar system) throughout solar system history (Crawford et al., 2010; Fagents et al., 2010). Much of this record will be di rectly relevant to understanding th e past habitability of our own planet.     ",

Pr otected either in the subsurface or in permanently shadowed craters (Seife, 2004; Vasavada et al., 1999), these might provide insights into the inventory of volatile  and/or organic material that penetrated the early inner Solar System, and what quantity may still do so today. Insofar as these organics might have provided an exogenous source of prebiotic organics necessary to kick-start life on the Earth, investiga ting organics on the Moon has important contributions to make to understanding the origin of life on the Earth. Indigenous organic processing on the Moon may also yield insights into the chemical pathways of alteration, and fate, of organics in  interplanetary space (e.g., Lucey, 2000). ",

Historically, much of the space biomedical science focus has b een upon whole-body physiology, reflecting the immediate challenge of maintaining astr onaut (and thus mi ssion) functionality (Garshnek, 1989; Williams, 2003). Most physiological systems are known to progressively \u2018adapt\u2019 to life in micrograv ity (Nicogossian et al ., 1994), however many encounter problems upon re-exposure to a gr avitation vector. Alterations in spatial orientation (Lipshits et al., 2005) and sens ory-motor function (e.g. Kalb and Solomon, 2007; Souvestre et al., 2008) are acutely challenging but re-adapt rapidly, whereas cardiovascular (Hargens and Richards on, 2009; Hughson, 2009) and musculoskeletal system (Narici and de Boer 2011) de-cond itioning can precipita te chronic health issues as well as imparing astronaut operati ons. A raft of countermeasures including  various exercise regimes, nutrition and behavioural support are employed in space missions (Convertino, 2002; Cavanagh et al.,  2005), but these fail to entirely ameliorate microgravity-induced de-condi tioning. As a consequence, the maximum \u2018recommended\u2019 stay on the International Sp ace Station (ISS) is currently 6 months (Williams et al., 2009).  ",

An abnormal gravity environment is  likely to inhibit sedimentation, equalising molecular (and t hus affecting electro-chemical gradients) and organelle distribution, and modify cyto skeletal activity and gene transcription (Cogoli and Cogoli-Greuter, 1997). Such processes may in part explain observed gravity-dependent changes in cellular growth, proliferati on and regeneration (Sonnenfeld and Shearer, 2002; Borchers, et  al., 2002), organisation (Vico et al., 2000), and healing (Davidson et al., 1999; Ra dek et al., 2008). For instance, reduced lymphocyte proliferation, delayed bone cell differentiation (Hughes-Fulford and Lewis, 1996), and retardation of pre- natal (e.g. Bruce, 2003) and post-natal  development (e.g. Ronca and Alberts, 1997) and locomotion (Walton, 1998) have all been observed in a number of animal models in microgravity.

The lunar partial gravity model would s upplement the knowledge accrued by \u2018long duration\u2019 ISS microgravity expo sure, by adding a point at 1/6th g from which to investigate gravity dose-dependence (e.g. Cockell, 2010). In addition, by providing a more tightly controlled environment in te rms of the nutritional, medical (including remote monitoring) and exercise counter measure support, the Moon would offer an opportunity to test the efficacy of counter measure and/or therapeutic approaches within otherwise \u2018healthy\u2019  and well motivated indi viduals (e.g. Green, 2010). The lunar partial gravity is likely to offer some protection to de-conditioning that will likely not only facilitate longe r operational durations than th e ISS, but also has greater relevance and applicability to life on Earth than the microgravity environment of the ISS. There would therefore be the opportunity to understa nd the physiological effects of gravity that are not possible within e ither a 1-g or a microgravity environment. Such studies were beyond the scope of the limited duration Apollo missions, but would be facilitated by longer-ter m human operations on the Moon.  ",

Examples include individualised medicine  (Kalow 2002), carcinogenesis (Rykova et al., 2008), viral virulence (Wilson et al., 2007), robotic surgery (Cermack, 2006), telemetric medical monitoring (Grigoriev and Egorov, 1997), and even basic health care delivery due to the severe resource a nd technical assistance limitations (Mortimer et al., 2004). In contrast to the popular myt h, space biomedical devices must be simple (to operate and repair), r obust, compact, light, low consumers, non-invasive and multi-faceted (e.g. diagnostic and interven tional ultrasound; Ma et al., 2007) and ideally preventative (Thirsk et al., 2009). Such characteristics possess value well beyond space applications, e.g. in  remote societies and disast er zones, and could also facilitate de-centralised car e provision within the developed world offering efficacy and cost-effectiveness benefits (Williams, 2002).

Almost the en tire electromagnetic spectrum is currently being used to  study the universe from radi o to high-energy gamma ray emission. Different frequencies typically rela te to different physical processes, and consequently the universe looks markedly different in optical, infrared, or radio wavelengths. Hence, during the last century modern telescopes have diversified and evolved enormously, fundamentally changing our view of the universe and our place therein. Due to their ever increasing sensitiv ity, which allows one to peer deeper and deeper into the earliest phases of the cosmos, the requirements for telescope sites have become more and more extreme: one simply needs the best possible observing conditions. The most important factors he re are light pollution (at the relevant frequencies) and distortions due  to the atmosphere. Light po llution is generally caused by any form of civilization, thereby pushing observatories to more and more remote locations. Detrimental effects of the atmosphere include: \uf0b7 temporary effects such as clouds and water vapour, which temporarily absorb and disturb optical or high- frequency radio radiation,  \uf0b7 turbulence in the ionosphere or troposphe re, which distorts radio or optical wave fronts, thereby severely degrading the image quality,   \uf0b7 air glow, which can overpower se nsitive infrared observations,  \uf0b7 total absorption of radiati on, e.g., of very low-frequency radio, infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray radiation.

            "text": "The Moon would be a logical next step in th e quest for the most suitable sites to be used for astronomy. An important secondary important factor in  selecting a site, however, is the available infrastructure: How accessible is the site for people and material? How does one obtain power and how  good is the data connection? Already for Antarctica this poses serious constraints, and it took a long time until this continent became useful for scientific exploi tation. It is needless to say that the Moon is even more difficult to reach. Hence, lik e Antarctica, any signi ficant exploitation of the Moon requires a developed infrastructure  \u2013 something that would likely become available only in conjunction with human exploration of the Moon. Even then one has  to assess how unique and useful the Moon is for astronomy in the first place. After all, the International Space Station (ISS), while  having a well-developed infrastructure available, is not used for telescopes; its small, relatively unstable platform in low-Earth orbit (LEO) is simply too poor a tele scope site to be competitive. Hence, the vast majority of space-based telescopes have been associated with free-flying satellites. Of course, some of these sa tellites, most notab ly the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), benefited from the heavy lift capabilities of th e Space Shuttle and the servicing possibilities the human sp ace flight program offered (NRC, 2005). Indeed, it is interesting to note that th e one human-serviced space telescope, HST, is in fact the most productive of all astronomy space missions even many years after its launch (see Tables 4 and 6 in Trimble and Ceja, 2008; HST produced 1063 papers in the time frame 2001-2003, compared to 724 fo r Chandra, the next most productive).

            "text": " There is a wide consensus that a low-freque ncy radio telescope (i .e. a radio telescope operating at frequencies below 30-100 MHz) would be the hi ghest priority (e.g., Jester and Falcke, 2009; Burns et al., 2009). Radio waves at these freque ncies are seriously distorted by the Earth\u2019s ionosphere and completely absorbed or reflected at frequencies below 10-30 MHz. Hence, th e low-frequency universe is the last  uncharted part of the electromagnetic spec trum, and a lunar infrastructure would greatly benefit its exploration. Of partic ular relevance for science here is the investigation of the \u201cdark ages\u201d of the un iverse. This is the epoch several hundred million years after the big bang, but before th e formation of the first stars and black holes, when the cosmos was mainly filled with dark matter and neutral hydrogen. This epoch contains still pristine informati on of the state of the big bang and can essentially only be observed through radi o emission from atomic hydrogen red-shifted to several tens of MHz. Th e best location to study this treasure trove of cosmology (Loeb and Zaldariaga 2004) would indeed be on the lunar far-side.   ",

The individual antennas ar e digitally connected to fo rm a large interferometer (a \u201cphased array\u201d), which act s as one large, st eerable telescope dish, but without any moving parts. These radio antennas can be made robust and lightweight to transport many of them into space, while the Moon\u2019 s gravity and surface would keep them fixed relative to each other. Moreover, if placed at the far-side of the Moon, the Moon itself would shield the telescope from any radio pollution (also called radio frequency interference, RFI) originating from Earth. This  RFI can be either of man-made origin or due to natural Auroral Kilometric Radi ation (AKR) in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. In fact \u2013 due to this shielding and lack of its own magnetic activity \u2013 the farside of the Moon probably belongs to the most radio-qu iet places in our sola r system. This has been long recognized and the Internati onal Telecommunication Union (ITU) has accordingly designated the lunar far-side as  a radio-quiet zone for radio astronomy(ITU Radio Regulations, Article 22, Secti on V). The installation of such a low-frequency radio array could pr oceed in several steps, star ting with a few antennas and then growing to a larger an d larger network (i deally out to te ns to hundreds or kilometres with thousands of antennas). Wh ile the first steps can certainly be done  robotically, a large-scale installation over such  diverse terrain and large distances, will ultimately be much more efficient with the presence of humans on the surface.

The huge cost overruns of the HST-successor, JWST, have shown how difficult it is to fold-up and bring even me dium-sized optical telescopes into space. For certain applications liquid-mirror te lescopes have been proposed, whereby the combination of a rotating fluid and the Moon\u2019s gravity would form a perfect (non-steerable) mirror that could de tect the very first stars in  the universe (Angel et al. 2008), although this technique currently has a rather low technical readiness. Perhaps a simpler, and scientifically topical and important, implementation of lunar-based telescopes would be to obtai n disc-integrated spectral, polarimetric, and albedo measurements of the Earth. Such observati ons could provide important insights into both the Earths radiation budget and climate (e.g. Pall\u00e9 and Goode, 2009), and the interpretation of observations of Earth- like exoplanets and the interpretation of planetary biosignatures (e.g. Sparks et al., 2010; Karalidi  et al., 2012).

Indeed, Apollo 16 deployed a UV telescope on the Moon (Carruthers, 1973) \u2013 a class of telescopes that was later flown on satellites (e.g. the International Ultraviolet Explorer, IUE). This would qualify as \u201c opportunistic\u201d science, i.e., missions that simply catch a ride, given it is there. At th e very least, an existing \u2018science-park\u2019 on the Moon would take the burden of taking al ong one\u2019s own attitude control, power-supply, or data handling capability, which now has to be carried by every astronomy satellite. Whether by th e time such an infrastr ucture is likely to be  available there will still a sufficient science case left for such sm all telescopes remains to be seen. On the other hand, it is worth noting that, perhaps surprisingly, sm all robotic telescopes have revolutionized some areas of astronomy (e.g., planet searches, Gamma-Ray-Burst afterglows) in recent years and may continue to do so.

Small optical/IR telescopes to observe the Earth from the nearside may also be scientifically valuable. Large (10 metre plus) optical tele scopes or interferom eters might at some point benefit from the lunar surface as a plat form, but the technical case for this still needs to be developed, and the Moon as a site for such telescopes needs to be better studied. Smaller telescopes could be inst alled, using lunar activ ities as opportunity. All options would certainly benefit from a sustainable human return to the Moon, but certainly will not drive it. This situation is , however, not very much different from the usage of Antarctica for astronomy, where astro physicists simply made use of the fact that Antarctic exploration programs and infr astructure already existed. Perhaps the same will happen with the Moon in the coming decades. ",

These lunar science objectives were strongly endorsed by the US National Res earch Council Report on the Scientific Context for Exploration of the Moon (NRC 2007), and a number of them (i.e. those which could be addressed by sample return from the South Pole-A itken Basin and by the creation of a lunar geophysics network) received high priority in the recent US Planetary Science Decadal Survey (NRC, 2011) . Addressing these objectives requires an end to the 40-year hiatus of lunar surface exploration, with the placing of scientific instruments on, and the return of samples from, the surface of the Moon, with a particular emphasis on regions not previously visited. It is  also clear that the lunar surface offers outstanding opportunities fo r research in astronomy, astrobiology, fundamental physics, life sciences  and human physiology and medicine. ",

            "text": "Many of these objectives, can be addresse d robotically, as re flected by the large number of proposals for lunar surface robotic expl oration that have been put forward in recent years (e.g. MoonLITE and MoonRaker, Gao et al., 2008; MoonRise, Jolliff et al., 2010; Lunar Beagle, Gibson et al ., 2010; SELENE-2, Hashimoto et al., 2011; Luna-Glob,  Mitrofanov et al ., 2011; Lunette, Neal et al ., 2011; LunarNet, Smith et al., 2012; Farside Explorer, Mimoun et al., 2012; and ESA\u2019s Lunar Lander, Carpenter et al., 2012). However, in the longer term, it is also clear that most of these scientific objectives would benefit from the scientif ic infrastructure, on the spot decision making, enhanced surface mobility, and samp le return capacity that would be  provided by renewed human operations on the lunar surface (e.g. Spudis, 2001; Garvin, 2004; Cockell, 2004; Crawford, 2004; 2012). Indeed, some of  these scientific objectives will be impossible to conduct r obotically (i.e. those related to human physiology and medicine where humans will form the experimental subjects), and others (e.g. deep drilling into the lunar crust to extract undisturbed palaeoregolith deposits with their potentially rich record of Solar System history) may be wholly impractical without a human presence. That said , it is also true that a human return to the Moon will benefit from robotic precurs or missions, for example to assess possible seismic and impact hazards, regolith prope rties (including possible dust toxicity; Linnarsson et al. 2012, this issue) , the radiation environment, and in situ  resource availability (Anand et al. 2012, this issue). Fo r all these reasons it is highly desirable that current plans for robotic  exploration of the lunar surface are developed in the context of a future human exploration programme. ",

In 2007 the World\u2019s space agencies came together to  develop the Global Exploration Strategy (GES), which lays the foundations for a gl obal human and robotic  space exploration programme (GES 2007).  One of the first fru its of the GES has been the development of a Global Exploration Roadmap (GER 2011) , which outlines possible international contributions to human and robotic missions  to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids and, eventually, Mars. Implementation of this  roadmap would provide many opportunities for pursuing the science objectives outlined in this paper, and lunar science would therefore be a major beneficiary of its implementation.

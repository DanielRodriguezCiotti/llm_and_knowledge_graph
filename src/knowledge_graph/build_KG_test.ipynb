In addition, the lunar surface offers outstanding opp ortunities for research in astronomy, astrobiology, fundamental physics,  life sciences and human physiology and medicine. This paper provides an inte rdisciplinary review of outstanding lunar science objectives in all of these different areas. It is concluded that addressing them satisfactorily will require an end to the 40- year hiatus of lunar surface exploration, and the placing of new scientific instrume nts on, and the return of additional samples from, the surface of the Moon. Some of thes e objectives can be achieved robotically (e.g. through targeted sample return, the de ployment of geophysical networks, and the placing of antennas on the lunar surface to form radio telescopes). However, in the longer term, most of these scientific obj ectives would benefit significantly from renewed human operations on the lunar surface. For these reasons it is highly desirable that current plans for renewed robotic surface exploration of the Moon are developed in the context of a future human lunar exploration programme, such as that proposed by the recently formulat ed Global Exploration Roadmap.

       "   'text': ' Over the last decade there has been a renaissance in lunar exploration conducted from orbit about the Moon, with the followi ng countries all sending remote-sensing spacecraft to lunar orbit during this period: European Space Agency: SMART-1 (2004); Japan: Kaguya (2007); China: Cha ng’e-1 (2007), Chang’e-2 (2010); India: Chandrayaan-1 (2008); and the United Stat es: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO; 2009), GRAIL (2012). However, none of thes e spacecraft were designed to land on the Moon’s surface in a controlled manner, although the US Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS; co-launched with LRO) and the Chandrayaan-1 Moon Impact Probe (MIP) di d deliberately impact the lunar surface in an effort to detect polar volatiles. Indeed, it is sobering to realise that no spacecraft of any kind has successfully landed on the Mo on in a controlled manner since the Russian robotic sample return mission L una 24 in August 1976, and that no human being has set foot on the Moon since Apollo 17 in December 1972. In this paper we argue that this long hiatus in lunar surface exploration has been to the detriment of lunar and planetary science, and indeed of other sciences also, and that the time has come to resume the robotic and human exploration of the surface of the Moon.  The strong scientific case for renewed luna r exploration was already recognized in a comprehensive study conducted by the European Space Agency in 1992 on “Europe’s Priorities for the Scientif ic Exploration and Utiliza tion of the Moon” (ESA 1992). Many of the conclusions of this earlier study  remain valid today, albeit with some need of updating in light of more recent di scoveries, and we will follow its basic framework in what follows. In particul ar, the ESA study found that lunar science objectives can logically be di vided into three categories: (i) Science of the Moon (i.e.  studies of the Moon itself); (ii) Science on the Moon (i .e. studies using the lunar surface as a platform for scie ntific investigations not di rectly related to the Moon itself); and (iii) Science from the Moon (i .e. studies utilising th e lunar surface as a platform for astronomical observations).

       "   'text': ' From a planetary science perspective, the primary importance of the Moon arises from the fact that, owing to a lack of recen t geological activity and active erosional processes, it has an extremely ancient surfac e, mostly older than 3 billion years with some areas extending almost all the way back  to the origin of the Moon 4.5 billion years ago (e.g. Hiesinger and Head 2006; Jaumann et al., 2012). Its relatively accessible near-surface environment theref ore preserves a record of the early geological evolution of a terrest rial planet, which more complex planets such as Earth, Venus and Mars, have long lost, and of the Earth-Moon system in particular. Moreover, the lunar surface provides a plat form for geophysical instruments (e.g. seismometers and heat-flow probes) to probe the structure and composition of the deep interior, which is also required if  we are to use the Moon as a model for terrestrial planet evolution.  Last, but not le ast, the Moon’s outer la yers also preserve a record of the environment in the i nner Solar System (e.g. meteorite flux, interplanetary dust density, solar wind flux and composition, galactic cosmic ray flux) throughout Solar System history, much of wh ich is relevant to understanding the past habitability of our own planet (e.g. Crawford, 2006; Cockell, 2010).    Gaining access to this information lies primarily in the domain of the geosciences (i.e. geology, geophysics, and geochemistry), and will  require a return to  the lunar surface with robotic and/or human missions.

However, the current calibration of the cratering rate, us ed to convert crater densities to absolute ages, is neither as complete nor as reliable as it is often made out to be. For example, there are no calibration points that are older than about 3.85 Ga , and crater ages younger than about 3 Ga are also uncertain (e .g. Hiesinger et al., 2012).  Furthermore,  longitudinal variations in the cratering ra te on the surface of the Moon are predicted by orbital dynamics models, bu t these are difficult to confirm with existing data (Le Feuvre and Wieczorek, 2011). Improving the calib ration of the cratering rate would be of great value for planetary science fo r the following three reasons: (i) It would provide better estimates for the ages of unsam pled regions of the lunar surface; (ii) It would provide us with a more reliable estima te of the impact hist ory of the inner Solar System, especially that of our  own planet; and (iii) The luna r impact rate is used, with various other assumptions, to date the surfaces of other planets for which samples have not been obtained (inc luding key events and stratig raphic boundaries on Mars), and to the extent that the lunar rate remains unreliable so do the age estimates of surfaces on the other terrestrial planets.

However, in  practice this is likely to require the implementation of multiple missions to many different sites (see the detailed discussi on by Stöffler, et al., 2006). These might be robotic missions, ideally involving r over-facilitated mob ility and either in situ  radiometric dating or, preferably, a sample  return capability (e.g. Shearer and Borg, 2006). The possibilities of robotic in situ  radiometric dating techniques have been investigated by a number of workers (e.g. Ta lboys et al., 2009; Trieloff et al., 2010), and such in situ  measurements may be able to address some key questions in lunar science (e.g. verifying the approximate ag es of the youngest lava flows estimated by crater counting). However, th e practicality of performing in situ  radiometric dating with sufficient accuracy to obtain definitive results for chronology has been questioned (e.g. Taylor et al., 2006). Additiona l robotic sample return missions to key localities, such as the South Pole-Aitken basin (as envisaged by the MoonRise proposal; Jolliff et al., 2010) would undoubtedly improve our knowledge in key respects (Cohen and Coker, 2010). However it is likely to prove impractical to target dedicated robotic sample return missions to sufficient locations to fully characterise lunar chronology. Given the enhanced mobility, sample collection efficiency and sample return capacity actually demonstrat ed by the Apollo missions (e.g. Vaniman et al., 1991; Crawford, 2012), it seems clear that obtainin g anything approaching a complete lunar impact chronology will, at the very least, be greatly facilitated by new human missions to the lunar surface.

The thickn ess of the crust, which is critical for estimating the bulk composition of the Moon, is  debated, with recent estimates being almost half of those made during the A pollo era. The existence of a seismic discontinuity in the mantle 500 km below the surface, which could either be a reflection of primordial differentiation or la ter magmatic processes, is also debated. Four heat flow measurements (at two site s each) were made during Apollo (Langseth et al. 1976) in order constr ain the Moon’s bulk compositi on and thermal evolution, but in retrospect, these were found to be ma de near the edge of an atypical province enriched in heat-producing elements (Jolliff et al., 2000). It is not clear if these unique measurements are representative of either the ancient feldspathic highlands terrane, or of the more volcanically active Procel larum KREEP terrane. Though most data indicate that the Moon has a small molten core (e.g. Weber et al., 2011), neither its size nor composition are well constrained, and the existence of a solid inner core has remained elusive.

Key instruments in this respect are seismometers, to probe the structure of the deep interior (e.g. Lognonné, 2005; Yama da et al., 2011), heat-flow probes to measure the heat loss from the lunar interior and its spatial variati ons (Langseth, et al., 1976), and magnetometers to measure th e thermal conductivity profile.

In 1998 the Lunar Prospector  neutron spectrometer f ound evidence of enhanced concentrations of hydrogen at the luna r poles (Feldman et al., 1998), which was widely interpreted as indicating the presence  of water ice in the floors of permanently shadowed polar craters. Radar observations ha ve also been used to infer the presence of ice in such regions (e.g. Spudis et al., 2010; but see Fa et al. 2011 for an alternative interpretation). The presence of water i ce in permanently shadowed craters was supported by the LCROSS impact experiment , which found a water ice concentration of 5.6 ± 2.9 % by weight  in the target regolith  at the Cabeus crater  (Colaprete et al., 2010). It seems likely that this  water is ultimately derived from the impacts of comets (and/or water-rich aste roids) with the lunar surface,  although solar wind implantation and endogenic sources might also contribut e (for a brief review see Anand, 2010). However, the inferred quantity of water is sensitive to the calibration of the spectrometers on the LCROSS probe and a numb er of other assumptions (Colaprete et al. 2010). Ideally, therefore, this result needs to be confirmed by in situ  measurements.  '},\n",

It is hypothesised this OH/H2O, which cannot exist as ice, is produced by the reduction of iron oxides in the regol ith by solar wind-implanted hydrogen, with OH/H 2O being retained in the relatively cold high-latitude regolith.

Even though the original volatiles will have been considerably reworked, it is likely that some information concerning the composition of the original sources will remain. Among other things, this may yield astrobiologically  important knowledge on the role of comets and meteorites in delivering volat iles and pre-biotic  organic materials to the terrestrial planets (Chyba and Sagan 1992; Pierazzo and Chyba 1999).    The processes involved in the creation, re tention, migration, and destruction of OH and H2O across the surface of the Moon are likely to be common on other air-less bodies, and quantifying them on th e Moon will give us better insight into the volatile history and potential av ailability of water elsewhere in the inner solar system.    \\uf0b7 Lunar polar ice deposits are of consider able astrobiological interest, even if they do not retain vestigial information concerning their ultimate sources. This is because any such ices will have b een subject to irradiation by galactic cosmic rays and, as such, may be e xpected to undergo organic synthesis  reactions (e.g. Lucey, 2000).

Almost the en tire electromagnetic spectrum is currently being used to  study the universe from radi o to high-energy gamma ray emission. Different frequencies typically rela te to different physical processes, and consequently the universe looks markedly different in optical, infrared, or radio wavelengths. Hence, during the last century modern telescopes have diversified and evolved enormously, fundamentally changing our view of the universe and our place therein. Due to their ever increasing sensitiv ity, which allows one to peer deeper and deeper into the earliest phases of the cosmos, the requirements for telescope sites have become more and more extreme: one simply needs the best possible observing conditions. The most important factors he re are light pollution (at the relevant frequencies) and distortions due  to the atmosphere. Light po llution is generally caused by any form of civilization, thereby pushing observatories to more and more remote locations. Detrimental effects of the atmosphere include: \\uf0b7 temporary effects such as clouds and water vapour, which temporarily absorb and disturb optical or high- frequency radio radiation,  \\uf0b7 turbulence in the ionosphere or troposphe re, which distorts radio or optical wave fronts, thereby severely degrading the image quality,   \\uf0b7 air glow, which can overpower se nsitive infrared observations,  \\uf0b7 total absorption of radiati on, e.g., of very low-frequency radio, infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray radiation.

Two of the mo st remote, but also most exquisite, astronomical sites on Earth are the Atacama desert and Antarctica. The former currently hosts some of the world’s larges t telescopes, including ESO’s 8m-class Very Large Telescopes (VLT), the ALMA sub-mm-wav e radio telescope, and in the future probably also the ~40 m diameter European  Extremely Large Te lescope (E-ELT; see http:// www.eso.org). A century after its init ial exploration, Antarc tica now also hosts a number of somewhat smaller telescopes (e.g., the South Pole Telescope, Carlstrom et al., 2011) as well as the giant IceCube detector. IceCube is the world’s largest neutrino observatory, using the ice itself as detector mate rial (e.g., Abbasi et al., 2011).  '},\n",

       "   'text': 'The Moon would be a logical next step in th e quest for the most suitable sites to be used for astronomy. An important secondary important factor in  selecting a site, however, is the available infrastructure: How accessible is the site for people and material? How does one obtain power and how  good is the data connection? Already for Antarctica this poses serious constraints, and it took a long time until this continent became useful for scientific exploi tation. It is needless to say that the Moon is even more difficult to reach. Hence, lik e Antarctica, any signi ficant exploitation of the Moon requires a developed infrastructure  – something that would likely become available only in conjunction with human exploration of the Moon. Even then one has  to assess how unique and useful the Moon is for astronomy in the first place. After all, the International Space Station (ISS), while  having a well-developed infrastructure available, is not used for telescopes; its small, relatively unstable platform in low-Earth orbit (LEO) is simply too poor a tele scope site to be competitive. Hence, the vast majority of space-based telescopes have been associated with free-flying satellites. Of course, some of these sa tellites, most notab ly the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), benefited from the heavy lift capabilities of th e Space Shuttle and the servicing possibilities the human sp ace flight program offered (NRC, 2005). Indeed, it is interesting to note that th e one human-serviced space telescope, HST, is in fact the most productive of all astronomy space missions even many years after its launch (see Tables 4 and 6 in Trimble and Ceja, 2008; HST produced 1063 papers in the time frame 2001-2003, compared to 724 fo r Chandra, the next most productive).

Radio waves at these freque ncies are seriously distorted by the Earth’s ionosphere and completely absorbed or reflected at frequencies below 10-30 MHz. Hence, th e low-frequency universe is the last  uncharted part of the electromagnetic spec trum, and a lunar infrastructure would greatly benefit its exploration. Of partic ular relevance for science here is the investigation of the “dark ages” of the un iverse. This is the epoch several hundred million years after the big bang, but before th e formation of the first stars and black holes, when the cosmos was mainly filled with dark matter and neutral hydrogen. This epoch contains still pristine informati on of the state of the big bang and can essentially only be observed through radi o emission from atomic hydrogen red-shifted to several tens of MHz. Th e best location to study this treasure trove of cosmology (Loeb and Zaldariaga 2004) would indeed be on the lunar far-side.   '},\n",

       "   'text': 'Low-frequency telescopes are currently being built using a network of many, relatively simple dipole-like antennas (e.g., the LOFAR telescope; van Haarlem et al. 2012). The individual antennas ar e digitally connected to fo rm a large interferometer (a “phased array”), which act s as one large, st eerable telescope dish, but without any moving parts. These radio antennas can be made robust and lightweight to transport many of them into space, while the Moon’ s gravity and surface would keep them fixed relative to each other. Moreover, if placed at the far-side of the Moon, the Moon itself would shield the telescope from any radio pollution (also called radio frequency interference, RFI) originating from Earth. This  RFI can be either of man-made origin or due to natural Auroral Kilometric Radi ation (AKR) in the Earth’s magnetosphere. In fact – due to this shielding and lack of its own magnetic activity – the farside of the Moon probably belongs to the most radio-qu iet places in our sola r system. This has been long recognized and the Internati onal Telecommunication Union (ITU) has accordingly designated the lunar far-side as  a radio-quiet zone for radio astronomy(ITU Radio Regulations, Article 22, Secti on V). The installation of such a low-frequency radio array could pr oceed in several steps, star ting with a few antennas and then growing to a larger an d larger network (i deally out to te ns to hundreds or kilometres with thousands of antennas). Wh ile the first steps can certainly be done  robotically, a large-scale installation over such  diverse terrain and large distances, will ultimately be much more efficient with the presence of humans on the surface.

       "   'text': 'In addition to radio telescopes, a number of  other types of lunar observatories have been discussed (for example, see the disc ussion reported by Crawford and Zarnecki, 2008). The huge cost overruns of the HST-successor, JWST, have shown how difficult it is to fold-up and bring even me dium-sized optical telescopes into space. For certain applications liquid-mirror te lescopes have been proposed, whereby the combination of a rotating fluid and the Moon’s gravity would form a perfect (non-steerable) mirror that could de tect the very first stars in  the universe (Angel et al. 2008), although this technique currently has a rather low technical readiness. Perhaps a simpler, and scientifically topical and important, implementation of lunar-based telescopes would be to obtai n disc-integrated spectral, polarimetric, and albedo measurements of the Earth. Such observati ons could provide important insights into both the Earths radiation budget and climate (e.g. Pallé and Goode, 2009), and the interpretation of observations of Earth- like exoplanets and the interpretation of planetary biosignatures (e.g. Sparks et al., 2010; Karalidi  et al., 2012).

Indeed, Apollo 16 deployed a UV telescope on the Moon (Carruthers, 1973) – a class of telescopes that was later flown on satellites (e.g. the International Ultraviolet Explorer, IUE). This would qualify as “ opportunistic” science, i.e., missions that simply catch a ride, given it is there. At th e very least, an existing ‘science-park’ on the Moon would take the burden of taking al ong one’s own attitude control, power-supply, or data handling capability, which now has to be carried by every astronomy satellite. Whether by th e time such an infrastr ucture is likely to be  available there will still a sufficient science case left for such sm all telescopes remains to be seen.

Small optical/IR telescopes to observe the Earth from the nearside may also be scientifically valuable. Large (10 metre plus) optical tele scopes or interferom eters might at some point benefit from the lunar surface as a plat form, but the technical case for this still needs to be developed, and the Moon as a site for such telescopes needs to be better studied. Smaller telescopes could be inst alled, using lunar activ ities as opportunity. All options would certainly benefit from a sustainable human return to the Moon, but certainly will not drive it. This situation is , however, not very much different from the usage of Antarctica for astronomy, where astro physicists simply made use of the fact that Antarctic exploration programs and infr astructure already existed.

Addressing these objectives requires an end to the 40-year hiatus of lunar surface exploration, with the placing of scientific instruments on, and the return of samples from, the surface of the Moon, with a particular emphasis on regions not previously visited.

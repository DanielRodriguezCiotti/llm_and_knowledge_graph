Invariant Mappings: Contrastive learning aids in learning invariant mappings, which are used in discrimination models.\n\n3. Siamese Network: Contrastive learning utilises Siamese networks, first introduced by Bromley et al. This type of network is especially used for metric learning.\n\n4. t-SNE Analysis: The result of applying contrastive learning can be visualized and analyzed using t-SNE.\n\n5. Feature Extraction: Contrastive learning is applied in feature extraction, a method inspired by Triplet Loss.\n\n6. Self-supervised Learning: Contrastive learning is a type of self-supervised learning.\n\n7. Data points: This learning method involves examining data points.\n\n8. Momentum Contrast (MoCo): It uses an encoder, and is produced by negative samples.\n\n9. SimCLR: It works to maximize the similarity of data samples.\n\n10. Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL): This method creates views of an image. \n\nFrom the structure, it seems that contrastive learning involves examining data points, using them to learn invariant mappings, and applying those mappings in various contexts, such as image classification, feature extraction, and visualization through t-SNE analysis. It\u2019s is a type of self-supervised learning which uses techniques like Siamese networks, Momentum Contrast (MoCo), SimCLR, and Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL)."
